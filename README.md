## What I learned through this Project?
- JWT based authentication -  I learned about JWT-based authentication, bcrypt hashing, session tokens, and the processes of signing, verifying, and handling tokens on the client side. This knowledge has equipped me with the skills needed to develop secure authentication systems.
- CRUD APIs - I also gained knowledge and experience in creating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs. This involved designing and implementing endpoints that allow for the basic operations of data manipulation.
